Notes: 
For Mac users (sorry - Windows people)
If there's a $ words, that means you should type the words after the dollar sign at the command line. 
If I write type "these words" then only type the words, not the quotation marks. 
How do you find the command line? You can press "command + space bar" and spotlight will come up. Type "terminal" and hit enter
