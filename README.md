#Not too fast, yet another Flask Tutorial
#-----------------------------------------

This is yet another Flask tutorial in the world, but...I don't jump from hello world to deployment. My aim was to explain the hidden brain of flask a bit more pedantically for newbies and none software developers. 

In the first section we create an app locally in a one page module. In the second section we expand the app to a package, and connect it to a database, still locally. In the third section we deploy it to heroku. 

#Original module code is found here with some edits: http://code.runnable.com/UiPcaBXaxGNYAAAL/how-to-upload-a-file-to-the-server-in-flask-for-python" 
#How to go from a module to a package is here: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/patterns/packages/# AnotherFormcopy

Part 1: We start with an application that can upload files with a button in module form. https://github.com/kathrynthegreat/katya_flask_tutorial/tree/master/1.AnotherForm_as_module
Part 2: We break the module up into a package and add 2 more functionalities - uploading data, and storing in a postgresql database.

Part 3: We deploy to Heroku. (repo to come)
