#Flask Tutorial, not too fast
#-------------------------

This is yet another Flask tutorial in the world, but...I don't jump from hello world to deployment. My aim was to explain the hidden brain of flask a bit more pedantically for newbies and none software developers. 

This code belongs to the the tutorial katya_flask_tutorial https://github.com/kathrynthegreat/katya_flask_tutorial
Part Two uses: https://github.com/kathrynthegreat/AnotherFormcopy

In this section we will get you the minimum viable solution for a flask app that has a front end where you can upload files (csv or pictures) and have them stored in a postgres database. In the next section we will deploy this app to heroku. 

#Original module code is found here with some edits: http://code.runnable.com/UiPcaBXaxGNYAAAL/how-to-upload-a-file-to-the-server-in-flask-for-python" 
#How to go from a module to a package is here: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/patterns/packages/# AnotherFormcopy

Part 1: We start with an application that can upload files with a button in module form. 
Part 2: We break the module up into a package and add 2 more functionalities - uploading data, and storing in a postgresql database. 
Part 3: We deploy to Heroku.
