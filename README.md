#Not so fast, yet another Flask Tutorial
#-----------------------------------------

This is yet another Flask tutorial in the world, but...I don't jump from hello world to deployment. My aim was to explain the hidden brain of flask a bit more pedantically for newbies and none software developers. 

In the first section we create an app locally in a one page module. In the second section we expand the app to a package, and connect it to a database, still locally. In the third section we deploy it to heroku. 

Part 1: We start with an application that can upload files with a button in module form. https://github.com/kathrynthegreat/katya_flask_tutorial/tree/master/1.AnotherForm_as_module

Part 2: We break the module up into a package and add 2 more functionalities - uploading data, and storing in a postgresql database.

Part 3: We deploy to Heroku.
